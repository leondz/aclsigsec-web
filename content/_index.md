* ACL = Association for Computational Linguistics, the professional organisation for NLP and computational linguistics research
* SIG = Special Interest Group
* SEC = Security

We host regular talks on NLP & LLM Security, a mailing list for people interesting in NLP & LLM security, and an annual research workshop. [Join us](/join)!

## Goals

The ACL Special Group on NLP Security exists to: 

1. provide infrastructure and community for those many ACL members working in NLP Security;
1. establish a serious research body that represents NLP and ACL interests in the burgeoning field of LLM and NLP security; and 
1. bridge the Information Security and Computational Linguistics communities, which is a link already actively being pursued by the Information Security community.
